### **Data Source**

The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the dataset titled *"Credit and SMEs Synth Data - Credit Analysis"*. This dataset is publicly available for use and can be accessed via the following link:

[Credit and SMEs Synth Data - Credit Analysis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/youssefismail20/credit-and-smes-synth-data-credit-analysis)

This dataset contains synthetic data intended for credit analysis, which is particularly useful for studying Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and their credit behavior. The data includes various features that are crucial for building models to assess credit risk, providing a valuable resource for financial analysis and decision-making processes.

## Detailed Methodologies

### 1. 5C Credit Assessment Framework

The system implements the traditional 5 C's of Credit with modern quantitative approaches:

#### Character Assessment (Weight: 20-25%)
```python
Character_Score = (Credit_History_Score √ó 0.4) + 
                 (Payment_Behavior_Score √ó 0.3) + 
                 (Management_Experience_Score √ó 0.3)
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Credit History**: Length and quality of credit relationships


- **Credit History**: `min(credit_history_years / 10, 1.0)`
- **Payment Behavior**: Timeliness and consistency of payments
- **Payment Behaviour**: 
  ```
  if payment_delays == 0: score = 1.0
  elif payment_delays <= 2: score = 0.8
  elif payment_delays <= 5: score = 0.6
  else: score = max(0.2, 1.0 - (payment_delays / 10))
  ```
- **Management Experience**: Leadership track record (for SMEs)
#### Capacity Assessment (Weight: 20-30%)
```python
Capacity_Score = (Income_Stability_Score √ó 0.4) + 
                (Debt_Service_Coverage √ó 0.3) + 
                (Cash_Flow_Analysis √ó 0.3)
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Monthly debt payments / Monthly income
  ** Debt to Income Ratio (Consumers)**: 
  ```
  loan_to_income = loan_amount / (transaction_amount √ó 12)
  if loan_to_income <= 0.2: score = 1.0
  elif loan_to_income <= 0.4: score = 0.8
  elif loan_to_income <= 0.6: score = 0.6
  else: score = max(0.2, 1.0 - (loan_to_income - 0.6) / 0.4 √ó 0.6)
  ```
  **Debt to Income Ratio (SMEs)**:
  ```
  loan_to_revenue = loan_amount / annual_revenue
  if loan_to_revenue <= 0.15: score = 1.0
  elif loan_to_revenue <= 0.25: score = 0.8
  elif loan_to_revenue <= 0.35: score = 0.6
  else: score = max(0.2, 1.0 - (loan_to_revenue - 0.35) / 0.35 √ó 0.6)
  ```
- **Current Ratio**: Current assets / Current liabilities
- **Cash Flow Coverage**: Operating cash flow / Total debt service

#### Capital Assessment (Weight: 20-30%)
```python
Capital_Score = (Equity_Ratio √ó 0.5) + 
               (Asset_Quality √ó 0.3) + 
               (Retained_Earnings √ó 0.2)
```

**Financial Strength Indicators:**
- **Equity Ratio**: Owner's equity / Total assets
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Total debt / Owner's equity
- **Asset Turnover**: Revenue / Total assets

#### Collateral Assessment (Weight: 10-30%) [THIS ONE THERE IS NOT IN DATASET]
```python
Collateral_Score
```
#### Conditions Assessment (Weight: 10-40%)
```python
Conditions_Score = (Economic_Environment √ó 0.4) + 
                  (Industry_Risk √ó 0.3) + 
                  (Market_Conditions √ó 0.3)
```

**External Factors:**
- **Economic Indicators**: GDP growth, inflation, interest rates
- **Industry Risk**: Sector-specific volatility and trends
- **Regulatory Environment**: Compliance and policy impacts

### 2. Economic Scenario Modeling

The system adapts risk assessment based on economic conditions:

#### Scenario Weight Configurations

| Scenario | Character | Capacity | Capital | Collateral | Conditions | Risk Threshold |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Normal** | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.25 | 0.15 | 0.10 | 60% |
| **Crisis/Recession** | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.30 | 0.10 | 0.10 | 70% |
| **MSME Expansion** | 0.20 | 0.25 | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.05 | 55% |
| **Budget Efficiency** | 0.15 | 0.20 | 0.25 | 0.10 | 0.30 | 70% |

#### Scenario-Specific Risk Adjustments
```python
Final_Score = Œ£(Component_Score √ó Scenario_Weight √ó Risk_Multiplier)

Risk_Multipliers = {
    'normal': 1.0,
    'crisis': 1.2,      # More conservative
    'msme': 0.9,        # More flexible
    'budget': 1.15      # Moderately conservative
}
```

### 3. Risk Assessment & Decision Framework

#### Credit Decision Matrix

| Score Range | Risk Level | Decision | Action Required |
|-------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **‚â• 0.70** | Low Risk | ‚úÖ APPROVE | Standard terms |
| **0.50-0.69** | Medium Risk | ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW | Additional documentation |
| **< 0.50** | High Risk | ‚ùå REJECT | Decline application |

#### Risk Calculation Methodology
```python
Portfolio_Risk = Œ£(Individual_Risk √ó Loan_Amount) / Total_Portfolio_Value

Risk_Concentration = max(Industry_Exposure) / Total_Portfolio

Diversification_Index = 1 - Œ£((Segment_i / Total)¬≤)
```
